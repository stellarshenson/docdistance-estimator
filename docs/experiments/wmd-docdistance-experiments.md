# WMD Document-Distance Experiments - tier contrast and source conditioning

Experiments log for the mmBERT Statement Mover's Distance from `../solution/wmd-docdistance-solution-sota.md`. Batch E01 ran five pre-registered levers to widen the source-free gold/adversarial gap in [`notebooks/experiments/E01-kj-wmd-contrast-hypotheses.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E01-kj-wmd-contrast-hypotheses.ipynb): one promoted (E01-H3 anisotropy removal), four refuted. Batch E02 builds and tests the source-conditioned two-axis distance (selection `D_sel` + grounding `D_grd`) from `../solution/wmd-source-conditioned-docdistance-solution-sota.md` in [`notebooks/experiments/E02-kj-source-conditioned-grounding.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E02-kj-source-conditioned-grounding.ipynb): selection axis confirmed, grounding axis confirmed at the tier level once aggregated to a joint premise. Batch E03 ran five source-conditioned improvement hypotheses in [`notebooks/experiments/E03-kj-source-conditioned-improvements.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E03-kj-source-conditioned-improvements.ipynb): the relevance-gated residual (H11) and the blended scalar (H14) confirmed, the numeric verifier (H10) and both reranker-cost levers (H12 cascade, H13 replacement) refuted - the cross-encoder reranker is load-bearing and the gate is met on correct failure-mode ordering, not on raw per-document ordinality where the symmetric scalar already passes this single fixture. Batch E04 ran five source-conditioned performance hypotheses on the GPU fp16 chain: anisotropy removal on the conditioned selection axis (H15) widens dynamic range ~7.4x at `0` violations - the one win, shipped as the default resolution pre-pass (opt-out via `anisotropy=False`); coverage-temperature sharpening (H16), a distilled-reranker replacement (H17), a cross-encoder cascade (H18) and the composite (H19) are refuted - the cross-encoder reranker stays load-bearing and its ~109 s/pair cost stands, with the H18 cascade the closest faithful speed-up (Spearman 0.98, 2.3x, but recall@15 0.87 short of the gate). Batch E05 ran five CPU-speed hypotheses - three relevance-scorer hunts (a smaller multilingual cross-encoder, a late-interaction ColBERT-style scorer, a learned-sparse SPLADE-style scorer) and two structural grid cuts (length-bucketed batching, source-statement clustering) - against a `>= 50%` CPU latency cut at a preserved verdict; all five refuted, the v2-m3 cross-encoder reranker is reconfirmed irreplaceable (no smaller scorer recalls its top-3) and the one practical win is a `43%` free CPU cut from length-bucketing (H23, bit-identical scores), 7 points short of the bar. Batch E06 reopens the two directions E05 left untested - a *trained* multilingual late-interaction ColBERT and a *trained* multilingual learned-sparse scorer (the E05 probes ran on an untrained mmBERT backbone) - and promotes length-bucketing to a reserved CPU-speed candidate, scored against a looser gate than E05: any lift over the shipped chain in either a performance metric or CPU latency, not the `>= 50%` cut.

- **Branch / artefacts** - baseline `notebooks/04-kj-wmd-document-distance.ipynb`; E01 execution [`notebooks/experiments/E01-kj-wmd-contrast-hypotheses.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E01-kj-wmd-contrast-hypotheses.ipynb); design `../solution/wmd-docdistance-solution-sota.md`
- **Data** - `data/interim/exec-summaries/ibm-ai-adoption/` (one source article, eleven summaries)

## Problem overview

Eleven executive summaries of one IBM AI-adoption article, three quality tiers, scored against the reference gold (`exec-summary-gold-opus-4-8`).

- **Tiers** - 7 gold (faithful, shared rules), 2 adv1 (information loss - numbers stripped), 2 adv2 (information noise - bloat, fabricated forecasts)
- **Size** - summaries segment to ~12 statements, the source article to 70; clouds small, exact OT is cheap
- **Baseline** - perfect ordinality (`0 / 24` violations), boundary margin only `+0.79` closeness points, contrast ratio `1.27x`
- **Core difficulty** - mmBERT embeddings are anisotropic; cosines bunch at 0.7-0.9, so the `√(2 − 2cos)` cost matrix is compressed and tiers sit close
- **Not tested** - generalisation beyond one article and one degradation design; a controlled probe, not a benchmark

## Executive summary

Two distances ship from this work. **Solution 1 - symmetric SMD** answers "how far apart are two documents" with one source-blind, metric scalar (E01); it orders every tier on this fixture at 0.08 ms/pair but cannot say *why* two documents differ. **Solution 2 - source-conditioned d(A,B|S)** re-bases the comparison on the shared source and splits the distance into `D_sel` (selection - does it cover the same content) and `D_grd` (grounding - is what it says supported), separating the two adversarial failure modes the symmetric scalar conflates (E02/E03). The converged design runs in `notebooks/05-kj-source-conditioned-distance.ipynb` (CPU INT8 or GPU) and the shipped library is validated end-to-end in `notebooks/09-kj-docdistance-api-e2e.ipynb`.

Five levers, one promoted (E01-H3 anisotropy removal), five variants refuted. The baseline exact SMD already orders every tier without error (`d' = 2.70`, `V = 0/24`) at 0.08 ms/pair, and no lever manufactures separation the embedding geometry does not already support.

E02 is a separate goal from E01 - not widening the symmetric gap but splitting the distance into selection and grounding axes when both documents share a source. The source-conditioned distance separates the two adversarial failure modes the symmetric scalar conflates; the selection axis is clean and the grounding axis works at the tier level once aggregated.

**Baseline performance** (notebook 04, SMD against the reference gold)

| measure | value |
|---|---|
| mean gold → ref | 0.332 |
| mean adversarial → ref | 0.423 |
| reference contrast ratio `R` | 1.27x |
| all-pairs contrast (gold-adv / gold-gold) | 1.15x |
| boundary margin `M` | +0.79 closeness pts (+0.012 SMD) |
| dynamic range `DR` (std of → ref) | 0.057 |

| gold closeness band | 73-82% |
| adversarial closeness band | 68-72% |

## Methodology and metrics

Each lever rebuilds the distance to the reference gold over all eleven summaries, recomputes the metrics, and compares to the baseline row.

- **Boundary margin** - `min(gold closeness) − max(adversarial closeness)`, closeness points on the 0-1 scale; comparable across methods, baseline `+0.79`, must stay `> 0`
- **Contrast ratio `R`** - `mean(adv → ref) / mean(gold → ref)`, scale-free, baseline `1.27x`
- **Dynamic range `DR`** - std of the ten `→ ref` distances, resolution proxy, baseline `0.057`
- **Separation `d'`** - `(mean adv − mean gold) / pooled std`, scale-free effect size, baseline `2.70`
- **Ordinality violations `V`** - count of (gold, adversarial) pairs ranked wrong, hard guardrail, must stay `0 / 24`
- **Metric guardrail** - a hypothesis claiming to be a metric must keep the triangle inequality; non-metric variants are flagged as discriminative scores

## KPIs - what we optimize and why

The metrics above, grouped by the decision each one drives, so every lever is judged against the KPI it targets and never at the cost of a guardrail. Four families - correctness (must hold), resolution (the axis with room), cost (deployment) and generalization (trust).

**Correctness guardrails** - hard constraints, never traded for a gain on another KPI

- **Ordinality violations `V`** - count of (gold, adversarial) pairs ranked wrong, current `0/24`; a distance that mis-ranks a faithful document against a degraded one is wrong at the most basic level, so this stays `0`
- **Gold intrusions** - faithful golds landing in the adversarial grounding band, current `2 → 0` after the E03-H11 gate; the per-document grounding-quality measure, a faithful document scored as fabrication is a false alarm
- **Severity order** - whether Set 2 (fabrication) sits above Set 1 (info-loss), the correct grounding severity; the conditioned distance exists to name which failure mode diverged, so an inverted severity breaks its central claim
- **Metric property** - the triangle inequality on the selection axis; clustering, retrieval and fixed thresholds rely on it, so a non-metric variant is a discriminative score, not a distance

**Resolution - the axis with room** - E01 showed ordering is near-ceiling, so dynamic range is where the gains are; the E04 dynamic-range levers target this family

- **Dynamic range `DR`** - std of the `→ ref` distances, symmetric baseline `0.057`, conditioned `D_sel` ~`0.019`; bunched distances cannot be thresholded or finely ranked, so wider spread makes the number actionable
- **Separation `d'`** - `(mean adv − mean gold) / pooled std`, baseline `2.70`; the scale-free gold-vs-adversarial effect size, resolution normalized
- **Boundary margin `M`** - `min(gold) − max(adversarial)` in closeness points, baseline `+0.79`; the safety gap, a thin margin is a fragile threshold (the E03-H11 v2 margin is thin at `0.216` vs the `0.220` floor)
- **Contrast ratio `R`** - `mean(adv) / mean(gold)`, baseline `1.27x`; scale-free gold → adversarial spread

**Cost - deployment** - decides whether each axis is always-on or on-demand; the E04 speed levers target this family

- **Latency** - symmetric `0.08` ms/pair, source-conditioned ~`109` s/pair on CPU INT8 with the reranker full grid at ~`60%`, ~`63x` faster on GPU fp16; the grounding cost decides whether `D_grd` runs on every pair or only on demand
- **Footprint** - the grounding cross-encoders are ~`1-2` GB FP and ~`300-570` MB INT8 each; `D_sel` alone (mmBERT) is the cheap, CPU / edge-deployable half

**Generalization - trust** - the standing gate, parked for a separate fixture

- **Cross-fixture replication** - every number here is one article and one degradation design, so a KPI that holds only on this fixture is not yet trustworthy; the severity win must replicate on a second source before the blend is trusted as a single scalar (scored later, not in E04)

## Setup

- **Fixtures** - `data/interim/exec-summaries/ibm-ai-adoption/summaries/*.md` (11), reference `exec-summary-gold-opus-4-8`
- **Pipeline** - `sat-3l-sm` segmenter → mmBERT (mean-pooled, L2-normalized) → SMD via POT `ot.emd2`
- **Dependencies** - `wtpsplit`, `transformers`, `torch`, `ot` (POT) in the conda base kernel; GPU RTX 5000 Ada
- **Reproducibility** - fixed seed; deterministic across runs apart from minor GPU non-determinism in the encoder
- **Execution vehicle** - [`notebooks/experiments/E01-kj-wmd-contrast-hypotheses.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E01-kj-wmd-contrast-hypotheses.ipynb); each hypothesis is one toggle over the nb04 baseline

## E01 - experiment batch 1

Five independent levers, pre-registered before any run, one toggle each over the nb04 baseline, executed in [`notebooks/experiments/E01-kj-wmd-contrast-hypotheses.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E01-kj-wmd-contrast-hypotheses.ipynb). Composable, but tested one at a time to isolate effect.

### E01-H1 Salience-weighted transport

- **Hypothesis** - because quantified claims carry the article's signal and uniform weights dilute them, salience-weighting (IDF × numeric) will lift the boundary margin and `R ≥ 1.40` while holding `0/24` violations
- **Lever** - transport weights (baseline uniform `1/n`)
- **Mechanism** - weight each statement by salience (corpus IDF × numeric-content boost, renormalized) so quantified claims dominate and filler is discounted
- **Prediction** - adv1 (drops claims) and adv2 (pads filler) pay more; margin up, `R ≥ 1.40`
- **Acceptance bar** - margin up, `V = 0`
- **Result** - `V = 1`, margin `−0.23`, `d'` 2.47, `R` 1.292; numeric fallback E01-H2 same failure (`V = 1`, margin `−0.16`, `R` 1.309)
- **Verdict** - Refuted; up-weighting numbers pulls the number-retaining adv2 tier into the gold band and breaks ordering, fallback confirms the mechanism not IDF noise

### E01-H3 Embedding anisotropy removal

- **Hypothesis** - because mmBERT embeddings are anisotropic and statement cosines are compressed, subtracting the dominant principal component will raise distance dynamic range ≥ 1.5x while preserving `0/24` ordinality violations
- **Lever** - embedding geometry
- **Mechanism** - mean-center the statement embeddings, subtract the top 1-3 principal components (all-but-the-top), re-L2-normalize, then cost
- **Prediction** - cost matrix de-compresses, `DR ≥ 1.5x`, margin widens
- **Acceptance bar** - `DR ≥ 1.5x` baseline and `V = 0`, swept `k ∈ {1,2,3}`
- **Result** (k=1) - `DR` 0.180 = 3.2x baseline, margin `+0.92` (up from +0.79), `V = 0`, `d'` slips to 2.34, latency ~2x
- **Verdict** - Promoted; clears the `DR ≥ 1.5x` bar and widens the margin at `V = 0`, the only lever to do so; caveat - it spreads the gold band too, so `d'` drops (resolution, not a sharper boundary)

### E01-H4 Sharpened ground cost - angular distance

- **Hypothesis** - because `arccos` expands the high-cosine region where statements bunch, the angular ground cost will widen the boundary margin while keeping the metric property and `0/24` violations
- **Lever** - ground cost function
- **Mechanism** - replace `√(2 − 2cos)` with angular distance `arccos(cos) / π`, a true metric that expands the high-cosine region
- **Prediction** - more spread among near-duplicate statements, margin up, metric preserved
- **Acceptance bar** - margin up, `V = 0`, triangle inequality intact
- **Result** - `V = 0`, `d'` 2.72 (baseline 2.70), margin `+0.37` (down from +0.79), metric kept
- **Verdict** - Refuted (null); `arccos` is near-affine to `√(2 − 2cos)` at these cosines, so the ranking barely moves - a valid metric, a no-op for separation

### E01-H5 Unbalanced / partial transport residual

- **Hypothesis** - because balanced OT force-matches every statement and hides omissions and additions, unbalanced OT with a folded residual will widen the margin most (`≥ +0.040`) while holding `0/24` violations
- **Lever** - OT formulation
- **Mechanism** - unbalanced OT (marginal-relaxation `reg_m`) with the unmatched residual folded into the score (`+ √2 · residual`)
- **Prediction** - residual loads the adversarial tiers hardest, the widest margin of the five (`≥ +0.040`)
- **Acceptance bar** - margin up, `V = 0`, sweep `reg_m`
- **Result** (reg_m=2.0) - `V = 0`, margin `+0.68` (below baseline +0.79), `d'` 2.57, non-metric, ~9.4 ms/pair (~120x exact SMD)
- **Verdict** - Refuted; the boldest prediction lands worse than baseline, drops the metric property, costs two orders of magnitude more latency; both tiers share enough content that the residual does not concentrate

### E01-H6 Tail-aware aggregation

- **Hypothesis** - because a few badly-matched statements are averaged away by the mean, a p90 tail of matched cost will sharpen tier separation while holding `0/24` violations
- **Lever** - aggregation of the transport plan
- **Mechanism** - report the cost-weighted p90 of matched cost instead of the mean, surfacing the few badly-matched statements the mean averages away
- **Prediction** - the tail separates the tiers more sharply
- **Acceptance bar** - margin up, `V = 0`
- **Result** - `V = 3`, margin `−1.39`, `d'` 1.79 (baseline 2.70), the worst performer
- **Verdict** - Refuted; at ~12 statements the p90 tail is dominated by one or two noisy alignments and reorders the tiers - the mean is the right aggregator

### Results table (E01)

| hypothesis | V | margin (clos pts) | d' | R | DR | metric | ms/pair | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| E01-H6 tail (p90) | 3/24 | −1.39 | 1.79 | 1.123 | 0.048 | no | 0.06 | Refuted |

### Benchmarks (E01)

Latency per document-pair, exact baseline SMD = 1x, measured on the RTX 5000 Ada over the ten non-reference summaries.

- **baseline exact SMD** - 0.08 ms/pair, the reference
- **E01-H1 / E01-H2 weighting** - 0.08 ms/pair, same solver, weights are free
- **E01-H4 angular** - 0.10 ms/pair, only the cost matrix changes
- **E01-H3 anisotropy** - 0.17 ms/pair (~2x), one extra SVD on the pooled embeddings
- **E01-H6 tail** - 0.06 ms/pair, cheapest, reuses the balanced plan
- **E01-H5 unbalanced** - 9.4 ms/pair (~120x), the majorization-minimization solver dominates

## E02 - experiment batch 2: source-conditioned grounding axis

A different question from E01 - not widening the symmetric gap, but splitting the distance into two axes when both documents derive from one source `S`. Tests the design in [`../solution/wmd-source-conditioned-docdistance-solution-sota.md`](../solution/wmd-source-conditioned-docdistance-solution-sota.md), executed in [`notebooks/experiments/E02-kj-source-conditioned-grounding.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E02-kj-source-conditioned-grounding.ipynb). Two axes - selection `D_sel` (coverage-profile OT over `S`, already shipped) and grounding `D_grd` (reranker × NLI residual, the deferred build). Pipeline adds `bge-reranker-v2-m3` and `mdeberta-mnli-xnli`, both OpenVINO INT8 on CPU.

- **Anchor** - `gold` (Opus 3-sweep); every summary scored `d(anchor, X | S)` on both axes plus the symmetric SMD baseline
- **Two rounds of grounding** - R1 single-premise (SummaC max over source), R2 top-k joint premise (`k = 3`, the design's aggregation)
- **Source** - 70 statements; the grounding sweep scores every (summary statement × source statement) pair through both cross-encoders

### E02-H7 Selection axis separates information loss

- **Hypothesis** - because info-loss strips source figures, `D_sel` will rank Set 1 above gold while gold stays clustered (selection axis carries omission)
- **Result** - D_sel gold 0.023, Set 1 0.060 (2.6x), Set 2 0.073; every adversarial above every gold, `0` ordinality violations on the selection axis
- **Verdict** - Confirmed; D_sel cleanly separates both adversarial tiers from gold, info-loss included

### E02-H8 Grounding axis isolates fabrication (aggregation required)

- **Hypothesis** - because info-noise fabricates unsupported claims, `D_grd` will rank Set 2 above gold and above Set 1, once grounding is aggregated over evidence (R2) not single-premise (R1)
- **Result R1** (single-premise) - gold 0.097, Set 1 0.206, Set 2 0.233; faithful info-loss almost level with fabrication, axis muddied
- **Result R2** (joint premise) - gold 0.120, Set 1 0.130, Set 2 0.232; aggregation drops info-loss to gold level while holding fabrication (1.8x over gold), but two gold summaries (haiku 0.230, v2 0.285) intrude into Set 2's range
- **Verdict** - Partially confirmed; R2 isolates Set 2 at the tier mean and beats R1, but the axis is a tier-level fabrication flag, not a clean per-document discriminator; contradiction mass is near-zero across tiers (numeric-entailment weakness), so the residual rides on the ungrounded component

### E02-H9 Two axes separate what the symmetric scalar conflates

- **Hypothesis** - the 2D `(D_sel, D_grd)` plane will place Set 1 and Set 2 in distinct regions the symmetric SMD conflates
- **Result** - symmetric SMD conflates and even mis-orders by severity (Set 1 0.452 ≈ Set 2 0.406, gold 0.287); the 2D plane places info-loss (high selection, low grounding) and info-noise (high selection, high grounding) in distinct regions
- **Verdict** - Confirmed (tier level); the grounding axis is what distinguishes the two failure modes

### Round comparison - R1 vs R2

| round | grounding | gold | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 1 vs gold | reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | single-premise max | 0.097 | 0.206 | 0.233 | 2.1x | faithful info-loss muddied with fabrication |
| R2 | top-3 joint premise | 0.120 | 0.130 | 0.232 | 1.1x | info-loss pulled to gold, fabrication held |

R2 promoted; single-premise NLI mis-grades a compressive faithful summary because no single source statement entails a claim fused from several - the documented SummaC failure. Fusing each statement's top-`k` reranked source into one premise fixes it.

### Results table (E02, tier means)

| axis | gold | Set 1 (info-loss) | Set 2 (info-noise) | separates? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D_sel (selection) | 0.023 | 0.060 | 0.073 | yes, 0 violations |
| D_grd R1 (grounding) | 0.097 | 0.206 | 0.233 | Set 2 ≈ Set 1, muddied |
| D_grd R2 (grounding) | 0.120 | 0.130 | 0.232 | Set 2 isolated at tier mean |
| SMD (symmetric baseline) | 0.287 | 0.452 | 0.406 | conflates Set 1 / Set 2 |

- **NLI joint premise R2** - 0.73 s/pair (0.7%), one call per summary statement, reuses the reranker top-k
- **selection + symmetric** - sub-ms (D_sel transport 0.8 ms, SMD 0.6 ms), negligible
- **end-to-end** - 109 s/pair, ~1000x the symmetric SMD; the grounding axis is a heavy diagnostic, not a cheap metric

## E03 - experiment batch 3: source-conditioned improvements

Five levers to turn the E02 grounding axis from a tier-level flag into a per-document metric and to cut its cost, all over the same `data/interim/exec-summaries/ibm-ai-adoption` fixture, executed in [`notebooks/experiments/E03-kj-source-conditioned-improvements.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E03-kj-source-conditioned-improvements.ipynb). Three target quality (the grounding weaknesses E02 exposed), two target performance (the reranker bottleneck). Two confirmed (H11, H14), three refuted (H10, H12, H13).

- **Headline** - the relevance-gate (H11) closes the per-document gold intrusion (2 → 0) and the blend (H14) then orders the two failure modes correctly (Set 2 fabrication above Set 1 info-loss) where the symmetric scalar inverts them; number-aware verification (H10) and both reranker-cost levers (H12, H13) do not survive this fixture
- **Load-bearing reranker** - neither a bi-encoder cosine pre-filter (H12, recall@10 of top-3 only 0.58) nor a cosine replacement (H13, relevance Spearman 0.40) preserves the grounding ranking; the 60% reranker cost is structural to this design

- **Aim** - improve the quality and performance of the source-conditioned distance `d(A,B|S)`
- **Quality targets** - the four E02 grounding weaknesses: gold intrusion (2 golds in Set 2's band), dead contradiction signal, per-document noise, number blindness
- **Performance target** - the 109 s/pair cost, dominated by the reranker full grid (66 s, 60.5%)
- **Pairing** - E03-H12 (conservative cascade) and E03-H13 (aggressive replacement) attack the same reranker cost; the H13 kill-gate routes to H12 on failure
- **Capstone** - E03-H14 composes the winning quality levers and tests the batch gate head-to-head against the symmetric SMD

### E03 gate - clean win over the symmetric distance

The whole batch is judged against one acceptance gate, fixed before any run: the improved conditioned distance must beat the symmetric SMD on common-source documents, the case where the symmetric scalar already fails.

- **Win condition** - `0` per-document ordinality violations separating gold from each adversarial tier on the conditioned axes AND linear separation of Set 1 from Set 2 on the `(D_sel, D_grd)` plane or a blended scalar `α·D_sel + (1−α)·D_grd`
- **Reference to beat** - symmetric SMD conflates and mis-orders by severity (Set 1 0.452 ≈ Set 2 0.406, gold 0.287)
- **Not-shipped clause** - a lever that improves an axis but does not move the batch toward this gate is recorded interesting-but-not-shipped

### E03-H10 Numeric-aware grounding verifier

- **Hypothesis** - because general NLI contradiction is ≈ 0 on quantitative claims yet both adversarial tiers are defined by numeric corruption (Set 1 strips figures, Set 2 fabricates or alters them), a numeric verifier that extracts figures from each summary statement and compares them to the reranker-aligned source figures will rank Set 2 ≥ 2x gold while gold's numeric residual stays ≤ 0.05, adding a signal NLI does not carry
- **Lever** - grounding residual composition (add a numeric-mismatch term to `D_grd`)
- **Mechanism** - number-entity extraction (percent, count, currency, year or forecast) per statement; match each summary figure to its source figure via the top-k reranked source; residual = share of summary figures unmatched (fabricated) or value-mismatched (wrong number); orthogonal to NLI entailment
- **Prediction** - Set 2 numeric residual ≥ 2x gold; gold ≤ 0.05; Set 1 low here, its loss shows on `D_sel`
- **Acceptance bar** - Set 2 ≥ 2x gold AND gold ≤ 0.05 AND fires where the NLI contradiction signal was dead
- **Kill-gate** - numeric density: figures must appear in ≥ 30% of statements (probe the fixture first); sparse → kill before any build
- **Result** - density 58% (gate passed); top-k aligned numeric residual Set 2 0.163 = 2.0x gold 0.080, gold 0.080 > the 0.05 bar (faithful golds sonnet 0.31, haiku 0.14 inflate - real figures whose aligned source is not the top-k); whole-source matching keeps gold low (0.018) but collapses Set 2 to 0.051 because the 82-figure source matches fabricated numbers by coincidence; NLI contradiction confirmed dead (gold 0.055, Set 2 0.007)
- **Verdict** - Refuted; the signal is orthogonal to the dead contradiction and the direction is right (Set 2 2x gold), but localized matching breaks the gold ≤ 0.05 bar and whole-source matching is defeated by the source's figure density - number-aware verification fails this fixture both ways

### E03-H11 Relevance-gated ungrounded residual

- **Hypothesis** - because a faithful compressive gold fuses several source sentences (low joint entailment but high max reranker relevance) while fabrication is genuinely novel (low entailment AND low relevance), gating the ungrounded mass by max reranker relevance will drop the two intruding golds (haiku 0.230, v2 0.285) below Set 2's band while holding Set 2 within 10% of R2
- **Lever** - residual definition (weight ungrounded mass by `1 − max_k r(a_i, s_k)`)
- **Mechanism** - only statements with low max source relevance count as ungrounded; high-relevance-but-low-entailment (compression) no longer inflates the residual
- **Prediction** - gold intrusion 2 → 0; gold tier mean below 0.13; Set 2 held ≈ 0.21-0.23
- **Acceptance bar** - per-document ordinality gold < Set 2 restored (0 intrusions) AND Set 2 within 10% of R2
- **Kill-gate** - the intruding golds must actually have high max-relevance (probe: their max `r` ≥ 0.6); if not, the intrusion is real divergence the gate cannot fix
- **Result** - kill-gate passed (intruding golds v2 mean max `r` 0.898, haiku 0.752); gating drops both below the Set 2 floor (haiku 0.230 → 0.053, v2 0.285 → 0.216), gold intrusions 2 → 0, gold tier mean 0.120 → 0.084, Set 2 0.232 → 0.236 (+2%, held within 10%); the v2 margin is thin (0.216 vs the 0.220 floor)
- **Verdict** - Confirmed; the one quality lever that lands - the per-document gold intrusion is closed while Set 2 holds, though the v2 margin is narrow

### E03-H12 Bi-encoder cascade pre-filter

- **Hypothesis** - because the reranker scores the full 12 × 70 grid (66 s, 60.5%) yet only the top-k per statement enters the premise, pre-selecting the top-m source per statement by the already-computed mmBERT cosine (m ≈ 10) will cut reranker calls ~7x and end-to-end latency ≥ 40% while preserving the `D_grd` ranking (Spearman ≥ 0.95 vs full grid)
- **Lever** - pipeline (bi-encoder shortlist before the cross-encoder)
- **Mechanism** - mmBERT cosine ranks the 70 source statements per summary statement; keep the top-m, run the reranker only on those, feed the reranker top-k into the premise as before
- **Prediction** - reranker 66 s → ≤ 10 s; end-to-end 109 s → ≤ 60 s; tier means within 5%; Spearman ≥ 0.95
- **Acceptance bar** - Spearman(`D_grd` vs full grid) ≥ 0.95 AND latency cut ≥ 40% AND tier separation preserved
- **Kill-gate** - bi-encoder top-m must contain the reranker top-k (recall@m ≥ 0.95 on a probe); else the shortlist drops the true evidence
- **Result** - kill-gate failed: recall@10 of the reranker top-3 is 0.576, so the cosine shortlist drops 42% of the true evidence; D_grd Spearman vs the full grid is 0.545 (bar 0.95), even though the latency cut is 82% (reranker 63.9 s → 11.7 s), better than predicted
- **Verdict** - Refuted (killed at gate); a fast shortlist that changes the answer - the bi-encoder cosine is a poor pre-filter for this cross-encoder

### E03-H13 Bi-encoder relevance replaces cross-encoder

- **Hypothesis** - because the mmBERT bi-encoder cosine may already rank source relevance closely enough, replacing the cross-encoder relevance term `r(a_i, s_k)` with the bi-encoder cosine removes the 66 s reranker stage entirely (→ 0, reuse the embeddings), cutting end-to-end to ≤ 45 s, while keeping the grounding verdict if the two relevance rankings agree
- **Lever** - scorer (drop the cross-encoder, use bi-encoder cosine as relevance)
- **Mechanism** - the grounding score becomes `g = cos(a_i, s_k) · P(entail)`; no separate reranker sweep, the selection-axis embeddings are reused
- **Prediction** - end-to-end 109 s → ≤ 45 s; Set 2 still isolated; no new gold intrusion vs the cross-encoder design
- **Acceptance bar** - end-to-end ≤ 45 s AND Set 2 isolated at tier mean AND no new intrusion
- **Kill-gate** - probe bi-encoder vs cross-encoder relevance Spearman on a sample; ≥ 0.70 to proceed; below → the cross-encoder carries irreplaceable compression / paraphrase signal → fall back to the H12 cascade
- **Result** - kill-gate failed: bi-vs-cross relevance Spearman 0.397 (bar 0.70); dropping the reranker collapses the chain to 0.9 s but corrupts grounding - gold intrusions rise 2 → 5, and Set 1 falls below gold at the tier mean (gold 0.120, Set 1 0.105, Set 2 0.208)
- **Verdict** - Refuted (killed at gate); the strongest result of the cost pair - the cross-encoder relevance is irreplaceable by the bi-encoder cosine, the H12 fallback also failed

### E03-H14 Blended conditioned scalar vs symmetric

- **Hypothesis** - because the symmetric SMD conflates and mis-orders the two failure modes (Set 1 0.452 ≈ Set 2 0.406) while the conditioned axes separate them, composing the winning quality levers (H10 numeric + H11 relevance-gate on `D_grd`, with `D_sel`) into a single blended scalar `α·D_sel + (1−α)·D_grd` (α swept) will order all tiers with 0 per-document violations - a result the symmetric distance cannot reach
- **Lever** - output (blend the two axes, benchmark head-to-head vs symmetric SMD)
- **Mechanism** - sweep α over the conditioned axes after H10 and H11 land, pick the operating point that orders the tiers, compare per-document ranking to the symmetric SMD
- **Prediction** - at some α the blend gives gold < Set 1, Set 2 at 0 violations with Set 1 / Set 2 linearly separable; symmetric SMD stays mis-ordered (Set 1 > Set 2)
- **Acceptance bar** - the batch gate: 0 per-document violations gold vs each tier AND Set 1 / Set 2 separated, where symmetric cannot → clean win
- **Kill-gate** - conditional on H10 or H11 landing; if neither quality lever clears its bar, `D_grd` stays a tier flag and the blend cannot beat symmetric per document → record "gate not met, conditioned remains tier-level"
- **Result** - H11 landed (H10 did not), so the improved grounding is the H11 relevance-gated ungrounded mass; min-max each axis, blend `α·D_sel + (1−α)·D_grd`; at `α ∈ [0.60, 0.90]` the blend gives 0/28 per-document violations AND Set 2 above Set 1 (correct grounding severity); the symmetric SMD reaches 0/28 violations too but inverts the severity (Set 1 0.452 > Set 2 0.406)
- **Verdict** - Confirmed (clean win on severity ordering); the blend orders the two failure modes correctly where the symmetric scalar inverts them, but the win is the ordering and the axis attribution, not raw gold-vs-adversarial ordinality - the symmetric scalar also clears 0/28 on this single fixture, so cross-fixture validation is required before generalizing

### Benchmarks (E03)

CPU INT8, the 11-document reranker grid plus the per-lever micro-benchmarks; the heavy stage is unchanged from E02.

- **per-document signal build** - ~48 s/document (the reranker full grid over `n_summary × 70` pairs), 534 s for all 11 documents; the dominant cost, as in E02
- **H12 cascade reranker** - full grid 910 pairs 63.9 s → cosine top-10 shortlist 130 pairs 11.7 s, an 82% latency cut, but the ranking shifts (Spearman 0.545) so the cut does not ship
- **H13 reranker-free chain** - 0.9 s end-to-end (embed + cosine + joint-premise NLI, no reranker), ~120x faster than the 109 s E02 chain, but grounding is corrupted (5 gold intrusions)
- **H11 / H14 post-processing** - sub-ms on the already-computed signals; the relevance-gate and the blend add no measurable cost over the R2 grounding axis
- **GPU vs CPU INT8 (grounding chain)** - the reranker full grid runs ~63x faster on the RTX 5000 Ada fp16 (107.5 s CPU INT8 → 1.72 s), and the whole 11-document signal build drops from 534 s to ~16 s; the tier verdicts (`D_sel` 0 violations, `D_grd` 0 gold intrusions, blend Set2>Set1) are identical on both devices despite different absolute fp16-vs-INT8 values (nb05)
- **Reading** - the only cheap, faithful win is the relevance-gate (free re-weighting of existing signals); the two levers that actually remove the reranker cost both break the grounding ranking

## E04 - experiment batch 4: source-conditioned performance

Five levers to make the shipped source-conditioned distance faster and higher-resolution without losing the correctness E02/E03 secured, all over the same `data/interim/exec-summaries/ibm-ai-adoption` fixture, executed on the GPU fp16 chain in [`notebooks/experiments/E04-kj-source-conditioned-performance.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E04-kj-source-conditioned-performance.ipynb). Two target resolution (the dynamic-range axis E01 left as the one with room, never applied to the conditioned distance), two target the reranker cost (the structural 60% the E03 bi-encoder levers could not remove), one composite capstone stacks the winners. One confirmed (H15), four refuted.

- **Headline** - anisotropy removal on the conditioned `D_sel` (H15) widens dynamic range ~7.4x at `0` violations, the one win; coverage temperature (H16) trades contrast for range the wrong way, a distilled reranker (H17) drops half the evidence, a cross-encoder cascade (H18) is the near-miss that clears fidelity and speed but fails the recall gate, and with no faithful speed lever the composite (H19) gains resolution only
- **Aim** - improve the conditioned distance on the resolution and cost KPIs without regressing a correctness guardrail
- **Resolution levers (H15, H16)** - act on the embedding axes (`D_sel` and the geometric residual), where anisotropy and the coverage temperature live; the reranker `D_grd` is text-based and untouched by them
- **Speed levers (H17, H18)** - act only on the reranker, the load-bearing cross-encoder; both keep a cross-encoder, since E03 proved the bi-encoder cosine neither shortlists nor replaces it
- **Pairing** - H17 (aggressive replacement) and H18 (conservative cascade) attack the same reranker cost; the H17 kill-gate routes to H18 on failure, as E03-H13 routed to H17
- **Capstone** - E04-H19 composes the landed resolution and speed winners and re-checks every KPI head-to-head against the E03 operating point and the symmetric SMD

### E04 gate - faster and sharper at no correctness cost

The batch is judged against one acceptance gate, fixed before any run: a lever ships only if it improves its target KPI while holding every correctness guardrail.

- **Win condition** - the shipped conditioned design ends with higher dynamic range and/or lower latency AND holds `0` `D_sel` ordinality violations, `0` gold intrusions on `D_grd`, and Set 2 above Set 1 severity
- **Reference to hold** - the E03 operating point (`D_sel` `0/24`, H16-gated `D_grd` `0` intrusions, blend Set2>Set1 at `α ≈ 0.75`)
- **Not-shipped clause** - a lever that moves its KPI but breaks a guardrail is recorded interesting-but-not-shipped
- **Out of scope** - cross-fixture generalization is parked for a separate second-source fixture; E04 is scored on the existing fixture only

### E04-H15 Anisotropy removal on the conditioned axes

- **Hypothesis** - because `D_sel` and the geometric residual ride the same anisotropic mmBERT cosines that compressed the symmetric distance (E01-H3 tripled DR 0.057 → 0.180), projecting out the shared direction over the pooled {A, B, S} statements before the coverage profile will widen the conditioned `D_sel` dynamic range ≥ 1.5x while holding `0` selection violations - and here the common direction is estimated from a real corpus (the 70-statement source pooled with A and B), the recommended use, not the single-pair case the library docstring warns against
- **Lever** - embedding geometry on the conditioned axes (`compute_source_conditioned(anisotropy=True)`, `all_but_the_top` already in `src/docdistance/distance.py`, never run on the conditioned distance)
- **Mechanism** - mean-center the pooled {A, B, S} statements, subtract the top-`k` principal components, re-L2-normalize, then build `coverage_profile` and the residual on the de-bunched cosines; `k` swept {1, 2, 3}
- **Prediction** - `D_sel` DR ≥ 1.5x its raw ~`0.019`, gold → adversarial contrast widens, `0` violations; the reranker `D_grd` is unchanged, anisotropy cannot reach a text-based score
- **Acceptance bar** - DR(`D_sel`) ≥ 1.5x baseline AND `0` selection-axis violations AND `D_grd` gold intrusions unchanged
- **Kill-gate** - the pooled {A, B, S} statement cosines must be anisotropic (mean off-diagonal cosine ≥ 0.6 on a probe); already-spread → removal is a no-op → kill
- **Result** - kill-gate passed (pooled mean off-diagonal cosine 0.736); all-but-the-top widens `D_sel` DR at every `k` (k=1 7.42x, k=2 6.39x, k=3 7.45x) at `0` violations; best k=3 DR 0.0193 → 0.144 = 7.45x, far past the 1.5x bar; contrast slips 2.31x → 2.04x, `D_grd` unchanged (text-blind, by construction)
- **Verdict** - Confirmed; clears DR ≥ 1.5x at `0` violations by a wide margin, the conditioned analogue of E01-H3 and a larger gain (7.4x vs 3.2x) because the conditioned coverage profiles start more bunched; caveat - it spreads the within-tier band too, so contrast does not improve (resolution, not a sharper boundary); ship as the default resolution pre-pass on the conditioned path (opt-out via `anisotropy=False`)

### E04-H16 Coverage-temperature sharpening

- **Hypothesis** - because the coverage softmax at `temperature = 0.1` spreads each statement's mass across many source statements and blurs the profile, lowering the temperature concentrates coverage onto the true source statement, widening the `D_sel` dynamic range and the gold → adversarial contrast while holding `0` violations
- **Lever** - the `coverage_profile` temperature (`src/docdistance/distance.py`, default `0.1`)
- **Mechanism** - a sharper `softmax(−cost / τ)` drives each statement's assignment toward one-hot on its nearest source statement, so covered and dropped content separate more in the profile before the selection OT
- **Prediction** - at some `τ < 0.1` the `D_sel` Set/gold contrast rises ≥ 20% and DR ≥ 1.3x its `τ = 0.1` value at `0` violations; too-low `τ` collapses to argmax and loses the soft signal
- **Acceptance bar** - contrast up ≥ 20% AND DR up AND `0` violations, `τ` swept {0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01}
- **Kill-gate** - the `τ` sweep must show a rising-then-saturating contrast curve; flat across `τ` (the soft assignment is already near-hard) → kill
- **Composability** - orthogonal to H15 (geometry vs softmax sharpness); both feed the H19 composite
- **Result** - the prediction inverts: lowering `τ` raises DR monotonically (0.0193 at 0.1 → 0.0487 at 0.01) but contrast FALLS (2.31x → 1.47x) and ordinality breaks (`V` 1 at τ=0.02, `V` 2 at τ=0.01); raising τ to 0.2 lifts contrast only to 2.46x (1.07x, below the +20% bar) while DR drops; no `τ` clears contrast ≥ 1.2x with DR up at `0` violations
- **Verdict** - Refuted; the sharper softmax does spread the distances but within-tier, lowering the gold/adversarial contrast and eventually breaking ordering - the opposite direction to the prediction; temperature trades contrast for range, it does not buy both

### E04-H17 Distilled cross-encoder reranker - replacement

- **Hypothesis** - because the cross-encoder is load-bearing (E03 killed both bi-encoder shortcuts) yet the `bge-reranker-v2-m3` full grid is 60% of the 109 s/pair cost, replacing it with a smaller distilled cross-encoder that keeps cross-attention (e.g. `bge-reranker-base` or a MiniLM cross-encoder) will cut the reranker stage ≥ 3x while preserving the `D_grd` ranking (Spearman ≥ 0.95 vs `v2-m3`)
- **Lever** - the reranker model (a smaller cross-encoder, not a bi-encoder - the distinction from the refuted E03-H12/H18)
- **Mechanism** - the same grounding chain with a cheaper cross-encoder backbone scoring the grid; the joint-premise aggregation and the H16 relevance-gate are unchanged, `D_grd` recomputed
- **Prediction** - reranker 66 s → ≤ 22 s CPU INT8, Spearman ≥ 0.95, tier means within 5%, `0` new gold intrusions
- **Acceptance bar** - Spearman(`D_grd` vs `v2-m3`) ≥ 0.95 AND reranker latency cut ≥ 3x AND `0` new gold intrusions
- **Kill-gate** - the small reranker top-3 must recall the `v2-m3` top-3 (recall@3 ≥ 0.90 on a probe); below → it changes the evidence like the cosine did → route to the H18 cascade
- **Result** - kill-gate failed: `bge-reranker-base` top-3 recalls only 0.547 of the `v2-m3` top-3 (bar 0.90); `D_grd` Spearman 0.70 (bar 0.95), reranker cut 2.64x (1.74 s → 0.66 s/document, below the 3x bar), and `1` new gold intrusion; every bar missed
- **Verdict** - Refuted (killed at gate); the distilled same-family reranker drops nearly half the true top-3 evidence and changes the grounding ranking - the cross-encoder is load-bearing even against its own smaller sibling, reinforcing the E03 finding

### E04-H18 Small cross-encoder cascade pre-filter

- **Hypothesis** - because the E03-H12 cascade failed only because the bi-encoder cosine was a poor pre-filter (recall@10 of the top-3 was 0.58), using a small cross-encoder to shortlist the top-`m` source per statement before `v2-m3` reranks only those `m` will cut `v2-m3` calls ≥ 2x while preserving the `D_grd` ranking (Spearman ≥ 0.95), because a cross-encoder pre-filter recalls the evidence the cosine dropped
- **Lever** - pipeline (a small cross-encoder shortlist before the `v2-m3` cross-encoder, replacing the refuted bi-encoder shortlist)
- **Mechanism** - the small cross-encoder scores the `n_summary × 70` grid cheaply and keeps the top-`m` per statement; `v2-m3` reranks only those `m` and its top-3 feed the joint premise as before
- **Prediction** - `v2-m3` calls 70 → `m` ~ 15 per statement, reranker stage ≥ 2x faster, Spearman ≥ 0.95, `0` new intrusions
- **Acceptance bar** - Spearman ≥ 0.95 AND `v2-m3` latency cut ≥ 2x AND `0` new intrusions
- **Kill-gate** - the small cross-encoder top-`m` must recall the `v2-m3` top-3 (recall@`m` ≥ 0.95, the bar the cosine failed at 0.58); below → the cascade drops true evidence → kill
- **Result** - the near-miss: MiniLM top-15 → `v2-m3` clears the fidelity bar (`D_grd` Spearman 0.976 ≥ 0.95) and the speed bar (2.28x, `v2-m3` calls 70 → 15 = 4.67x), but the kill-gate fails (recall@15 of the `v2-m3` top-3 is 0.867, bar 0.95) and the 13% dropped evidence adds `1` gold intrusion
- **Verdict** - Refuted (killed at gate); the cross-encoder cascade is far closer than the E03 bi-encoder (Spearman 0.98 vs 0.55) and would ship on fidelity and speed alone, but the dropped top-3 evidence breaks a correctness guardrail - the most promising open speed direction (a larger `m` or a better-matched pre-filter)

### E04-H19 Composite conditioned distance

- **Hypothesis** - because the resolution levers (H15, H16) act on the embedding geometry and the speed levers (H17, H18) act on the reranker, orthogonal parts of the chain, stacking the landed winners into the shipped conditioned scalar will raise resolution and cut cost at once with no correctness regression on this fixture
- **Lever** - composition (stack the landed levers, benchmark the composite scalar against the E03 operating point and the symmetric SMD)
- **Mechanism** - apply the landed resolution lever(s) to `D_sel` and the residual, run `D_grd` through the landed faster reranker, blend `α·D_sel + (1−α)·D_grd` at the E03 operating point `α ≈ 0.75`, recompute every KPI
- **Prediction** - composite DR ≥ the best single-lever DR, end-to-end latency ≤ the best single speed lever, all correctness guardrails held, the severity win over symmetric preserved
- **Acceptance bar** - net DR up AND end-to-end latency down AND `0` `D_sel` violations AND `0` gold intrusions AND Set 2 above Set 1, all at once, no guardrail regressed
- **Kill-gate** - at least one resolution lever (H15 or H16) AND at least one speed lever (H17 or H18) must clear its bar; if a class is empty the composite reduces to the E03 design and the missing axis is recorded "no E04 gain"
- **Cross-fixture** - parked; the second-source replication is scored later on a separate fixture, not in this batch
- **Result** - kill-gate failed: no speed lever landed (H17 and H18 both refuted), so the composite reduces to the H15 resolution lever on the baseline reranker - `D_sel` DR 7.45x, `0` violations, `0` gold intrusions, blend Set2>Set1 (vs symmetric Set1>Set2), every guardrail held and severity correct, but `latency cut 1.0x`, no speed gain
- **Verdict** - Refuted (killed at gate); the resolution half holds every guardrail and fixes the severity, but with no faithful speed lever the composite gains resolution only, not the combined faster-and-sharper win - the reranker cost stands

Measured on the GPU fp16 chain; the baseline is the E03 operating point (`D_sel` DR 0.0193, `0` violations, contrast 2.31x; `D_grd` `0` gold intrusions; symmetric severity Set1>Set2).

### Benchmarks (E04)

GPU fp16, reranker grid over one document (12 × 70 = 840 pairs); the embedding levers are post-processing on the already-computed coverage profiles.

- **v2-m3 grid** - 1.74 s/document, the reference reranker
- **H17 bge-reranker-base** - 0.66 s/document, 2.64x faster, but recall@3 of the v2-m3 top-3 is only 0.55
- **H18 MiniLM pre-filter** - 0.39 s/document; the cascade (MiniLM grid + v2-m3 on 15 of 70) is ~0.77 s/document, 2.28x, recall@15 0.87
- **H15 anisotropy / H16 temperature** - sub-second post-processing on the coverage profiles, no reranker cost; the resolution levers are free relative to the grounding chain

## E05 - experiment batch 5: source-conditioned CPU speed

Five levers to cut the shipped source-conditioned CPU latency by `>= 50%` without losing the correctness E02/E03/E04 secured, all over the same `data/interim/exec-summaries/ibm-ai-adoption` fixture, executed on the CPU OpenVINO INT8 chain (fidelity grids on GPU fp16) in [`notebooks/experiments/E05-kj-source-conditioned-cpu-speed.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E05-kj-source-conditioned-cpu-speed.ipynb). Three target the per-pair scorer cost (a hunt over relevance-scorer architectures - dense cross-encoder, multi-vector late-interaction, learned-sparse), two target the structural grid factors (sequence padding, source columns). All five refuted against the gate.

- **Headline** - no lever clears the `>= 50%` CPU gate at a preserved verdict; the v2-m3 cross-encoder reranker is reconfirmed irreplaceable - no smaller scorer recalls its top-3 (mmarco-MiniLM 118M recall@3 `0.45`, jina-reranker-v2 278M `0.63`, late-interaction MaxSim `0.47`, SPLADE proxy `0.08`, vs the `0.90` bar and the cosine floor `0.39`), jina the closest at `D_grd` Spearman `0.927`
- **The one practical win** - length-bucketing (H23) cuts the shipped CPU reranker `73.2 s -> 42.0 s` (`43%`) at bit-identical scores (Spearman `1.0000`), `7` points short of the `50%` bar but zero correctness risk - worth shipping as a portable default
- **Floor across six classes** - E03 (bi-encoder), E04 (distilled `bge-reranker-base`, English MiniLM cascade), E05 (two multilingual cross-encoders, late-interaction, learned-sparse): the cross-encoder is irreplaceable on this fixture, and lower precision was never the lever (compute-bound encoder, no KV cache)
- **Corrected baseline** - the shipped CPU cost is ~67 s/pair, ~99% the reranker grid; the "~109 s/pair, NLI ~38%" benchmark includes the R1 single-premise NLI sweep that the shipped `D_grd` (relevance gate + R2 joint premise) never runs, so the grounding NLI is 0.7 s, not 42 s, and the reranker grid is the entire CPU target
- **One axis only** - E05 touches the non-OT grounding axis `D_grd` (the reranker grid); the selection axis `D_sel` (exact OT over coverage profiles, metric, sub-second) is untouched
- **Portable** - the shipped chain is OpenVINO INT8 artifacts that run on any CPU, so every lever must yield a portable model or transform; a host-specific runtime / kernel hunt is out, and every landed scorer ships as portable OpenVINO INT8
- **Precision ruled out** - the reranker is an encoder (one forward per pair, no KV cache) and the grid is compute-bound (per batch-of-256 the ~568 MB INT8 weights stream once in ~3 ms against ~16 s of compute); sub-INT8 / turboquant saves memory traffic the workload is not bound on and AVX-512-VNNI has no fast INT4 matmul, so lower precision cannot deliver the cut - a roofline probe (throughput vs batch and vs precision) confirms compute-bound before any precision work

### E05 gate - >= 50% CPU latency at a preserved verdict

The batch is judged against one acceptance gate, fixed before any run: a lever ships only if it cuts shipped CPU INT8 reranker latency while holding every correctness guardrail.

- **Win condition** - `>= 50%` CPU latency cut AND `0` `D_sel` violations AND `0` gold intrusions on `D_grd` AND Set 2 above Set 1 severity AND the `D_grd` ranking preserved (Spearman vs the full `v2-m3` grid `>= 0.95`)
- **Reference to hold** - the E03/E04 operating point on the existing fixture
- **Not-shipped clause** - a lever that cuts latency but moves the ranking is recorded interesting-but-not-shipped
- **Out of scope** - cross-fixture generalization (parked) and any host-specific runtime tuning (the portable constraint)

### E05-H20 Smaller multilingual cross-encoder reranker

- **Hypothesis** - because the reranker is ~99% of CPU cost and E03/E04 ruled out only a cosine, one distilled English-leaning `bge-reranker-base`, and an English-only MiniLM pre-filter - never a purpose-built smaller MULTILINGUAL cross-encoder - a candidate roughly half the 568M `v2-m3` size that holds the `D_grd` ranking will cut per-pair CPU cost `>= 2x` as a drop-in replacement, with a cascade pre-filter fallback (the E04-H18 lever at a recall-safe `m`) for a candidate that ranks well but not well enough to replace
- **Lever** - the reranker model (a smaller multilingual cross-encoder), evaluated as replacement first, cascade pre-filter on near-miss; candidates `Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-reranker-base` (~306M), `jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual` (~278M), `cross-encoder/mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1` (~118M, the multilingual MiniLM E04-H18 lacked)
- **Prediction** - at least one candidate holds `D_grd` Spearman `>= 0.95` and recall@3 of the `v2-m3` top-3 `>= 0.90` at a CPU latency cut `>= 50%`, `0` new gold intrusions, Set2>Set1 preserved
- **Acceptance bar** - replacement: Spearman `>= 0.95` AND recall@3 `>= 0.90` AND CPU cut `>= 50%` AND `0` new intrusions AND Set2>Set1; cascade fallback: recall@`m` of the `v2-m3` top-3 `>= 0.95` at `m < 35` AND net `v2-m3` cut `>= 50%`
- **Kill-gate** - probe recall@3 of the `v2-m3` top-3 per candidate; if every candidate `< 0.90` (replacement) AND no cascade clears recall@`m<35` `>= 0.95`, the cross-encoder floor is confirmed - kill this lever, the 50% falls to the others
- **Result** - gte (`306M`) would not load (custom code clashes with transformers 5.x, dropped per the GPU rules), so the hunt ran two multilingual cross-encoders: mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12 (`118M`) recall@3 `0.451`, `D_grd` Spearman `0.576`; jina-reranker-v2 (`278M`) recall@3 `0.628`, Spearman `0.927`, `+1` gold intrusion, recall@`m` reaching `0.95` only at `m = 34`; both far below the `0.90` replacement bar and neither cascades at `m < 34` (the single-vector cosine floor on this fixture is recall@3 `0.385`); CPU cut would be `85-88%` if either landed
- **Verdict** - Refuted; even a 278M multilingual cross-encoder does not reproduce the v2-m3 top-3 (Spearman `0.927` is the closest yet, short of `0.95`), the cross-encoder floor stands - jina is the nearest open replacement

### E05-H21 Late-interaction (ColBERT-style) multilingual scorer

- **Hypothesis** - because the refuted bi-encoder failed (recall 0.58) only because a single pooled vector is too lossy, a multi-vector late-interaction scorer (ColBERT MaxSim over token embeddings) will keep far more of the cross-encoder signal while staying cheap, and - unlike the cross-encoder - encode the 70 source statements' token vectors once per source (cacheable, amortized across every document scored against `S`), so the per-document marginal cost is the query-side encode plus MaxSim
- **Lever** - relevance scorer architecture (multilingual late-interaction); candidates `jinaai/jina-colbert-v2`, `answerdotai/answerai-colbert-small-v1`; replacement (MaxSim relevance directly) or cached high-recall pre-filter feeding `v2-m3` / the H20 winner on the top-`m`
- **Prediction** - MaxSim recall@3 of the `v2-m3` top-3 `>= 0.90` (replacement) or `>= 0.95` at `m < 35` (pre-filter), source token vectors cached so per-document CPU cost `>= 3x` below the cross-encoder grid, Spearman `>= 0.95`, `0` new intrusions
- **Acceptance bar** - replacement: Spearman `>= 0.95` AND recall@3 `>= 0.90` AND CPU cut `>= 50%` AND `0` new intrusions AND Set2>Set1; pre-filter: recall@`m` `>= 0.95` at `m < 35` AND net cut `>= 50%` AND `0` new intrusions
- **Kill-gate** - late-interaction MaxSim recall@3 must beat the bi-encoder cosine 0.58 on a probe (`>= 0.80`) to be worth wiring; at or below the pooled-cosine recall - MaxSim adds nothing here - kill
- **Result** - MaxSim over mmBERT token embeddings recall@3 `0.469` - it beats the single-vector cosine (`0.385`) but falls far short of the `0.80` gate; `D_grd` Spearman `0.079`, recall@`m` never reaches `0.95`; multi-vector late interaction helps marginally over the pooled vector but does not recover the cross-encoder ranking on this untrained backbone
- **Verdict** - Refuted (killed at gate); late interaction beats single-vector cosine but misses the `0.80` gate by a wide margin - a trained multilingual ColBERT is the untested upper bound

### E05-H22 Learned-sparse (SPLADE-style) multilingual scorer

- **Hypothesis** - because the cascade needs high recall of the `v2-m3` top-3 cheaply and the dense single-vector cosine failed (0.58) by collapsing lexical evidence into one vector, a learned-sparse scorer that expands each statement into weighted term matches - a portable, very cheap inner product - will catch the term-overlap evidence the pooled vector dropped, serving as a cached high-recall pre-filter feeding the cross-encoder / late-interaction winner on the top-`m`
- **Lever** - relevance scorer architecture (multilingual learned-sparse), cached high-recall pre-filter; candidates a multilingual SPLADE, `BAAI/bge-m3` sparse / lexical-weight mode, an `opensearch-project` multilingual sparse encoder
- **Mechanism** - sparse term-weight vectors per statement (source side cached once per source), shortlist top-`m` by sparse score, rerank the `m` with the landed cross-encoder / late-interaction scorer
- **Prediction** - sparse recall@`m` of the `v2-m3` top-3 `>= 0.95` at `m < 35`, sub-second sparse pre-filter, net CPU cut `>= 50%`, Spearman `>= 0.95`, `0` new intrusions
- **Acceptance bar** - recall@`m` `>= 0.95` at `m < 35` AND net CPU cut `>= 50%` AND `0` new intrusions AND Set2>Set1
- **Kill-gate** - sparse recall@`m` must beat the dense cosine 0.58 on a probe (`>= 0.80` at `m = 15`) to be worth wiring; at or below - sparse adds no recall over the pooled vector here - kill
- **Result** - the untrained mmBERT MLM-head SPLADE recall@15 `0.344`, below even the single-vector cosine floor `0.612` (recall@3 `0.078`); the proxy is too weak because real SPLADE is retrieval-fine-tuned and the MLM head is not
- **Verdict** - Killed at gate (proxy); the untrained MLM-head sparse score is below the cosine floor, so it does not refute a trained multilingual SPLADE - that remains untested (no `FlagEmbedding` in the environment)

### E05-H23 Length-bucketed reranker batching

- **Hypothesis** - because `MAX_TOKENS = 256` with `padding=True` over unsorted sentence-level pairs (~30-80 tokens) pads most pairs far above their real length, and attention is O(L^2), sorting the pairs by tokenized length and batching contiguous (pad to the bucket, not the global max) plus setting `max_length` to the real 100th-percentile pair length will cut the padded-token volume and reranker latency at numerically identical scores (no real pair truncated)
- **Lever** - tokenization / batch ordering (length-bucket the flat pair list, tighten `max_length`); not an OpenVINO hint, not a model change - portable, composes with whatever scorer H20/H21/H22 lands
- **Prediction** - padded-token volume down `>= 2x`, reranker latency 66 → `<= 33` s/pair, `D_grd` Spearman `>= 0.999`, `0` new intrusions by construction
- **Acceptance bar** - reranker latency cut `>= 50%` AND Spearman `>= 0.999` AND `0` new intrusions AND `0` real pair truncated (100th-percentile pair length `<=` the chosen `max_length`)
- **Kill-gate** - probe the pair token-length distribution; current padded-token volume must be `>= 1.5x` the unpadded volume; if pairs already pack tight (most near 256) - no headroom - kill
- **Result** - the `8,960` pairs carry `2.82x` padded-token waste (median 57 tokens, padded to 256, kill-gate passed); length-sorting the grid and tightening `max_length` to the 100th percentile cuts the shipped CPU OpenVINO INT8 reranker `73.2 s -> 42.0 s` (`43%`) at bit-identical relevance (Spearman `1.0000`); the token-volume drop projects `62%` but the INT8 kernel does not scale perfectly linearly so the measured cut is `43%`
- **Verdict** - Refuted (near-miss); a real `43%` CPU cut at an unchanged verdict, `7` points short of the `50%` bar - zero correctness risk and worth shipping as a portable default despite missing the formal gate

### E05-H24 Source-statement clustering shrinks the grid columns

- **Hypothesis** - because the 70 source statements are one article's heavy restatement (82 figures) re-scored against every document, clustering them into `k` medoids by mmBERT cosine once per source - amortized across every `(A,B)` pair sharing `S` - and scoring each doc statement against the `k` medoids will cut reranker pairs 70/`k`x while the per-statement top-3 evidence survives, because (unlike the refuted E03-H12 per-query cosine shortlist) this only collapses genuine near-duplicate source statements
- **Lever** - source cardinality (agglomerative / medoid clustering of the source embeddings at a high cosine-merge threshold, score doc × `k`); a one-time source-side compression, distinct from any per-query pre-filter
- **Prediction** - at a threshold giving `k ~ 28-35`, reranker pairs cut `>= 2x`, CPU latency 67 → `<= 34` s/pair, `D_grd` Spearman `>= 0.95`, `0` new intrusions
- **Acceptance bar** - reranker latency cut `>= 50%` (`k <= 33`) AND Spearman `>= 0.95` AND `0` new intrusions AND the `v2-m3` top-3 source per doc statement recalled among the `k` medoids `>= 0.95`
- **Kill-gate** - the source must be compressible: probe within-source redundancy (`>= 30%` of the 70 statements have a within-source cosine neighbour `>= 0.85`, OR the eigenspectrum reaches 95% energy by `k_eff <= 45`); a near-orthogonal source - kill before any build
- **Result** - the source is `91%` redundant (every statement has a `>= 0.85` neighbour) and spans only `k_eff = 10` effective dimensions (kill-gate passed), but the redundancy is soft: clustering to the 50%-cut point (`k <= 35`) drops top-3 recall to `0.762` and `D_grd` Spearman to `0.806`; the safe ceiling is `k = 45` (`36%` cut, recall `0.936`, Spearman `0.842`) - no `k` clears recall `>= 0.95` AND Spearman `>= 0.95` AND cut `>= 50%`
- **Verdict** - Refuted; the source compresses but not to half without losing the fine top-3 distinctions grounding needs - a near-duplicate merge, not an exact one

### Pre-registration table (E05)

| hypothesis | lever | prediction | acceptance bar | kill-gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E05-H20 smaller cross-encoder | reranker model | Spearman ≥ 0.95, recall@3 ≥ 0.90, ≥ 50% cut | replace: Spearman ≥ 0.95 AND recall@3 ≥ 0.90 AND ≥ 50% AND 0 new; cascade: recall@m ≥ 0.95 at m<35 | candidate recall@3 of v2-m3 top-3 ≥ 0.90 (else cascade ≥ 0.95) |

### Results table (E05)

Fidelity is measured against the v2-m3 top-3 source per statement (recall) and the per-document `D_grd` ranking (Spearman over the 11 documents); the single-vector cosine floor on this fixture is recall@3 `0.385`, recall@15 `0.612`.

| hypothesis | target | key result | bar | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E05-H20 cross-encoder | model size | jina 278M recall@3 0.63 / Spearman 0.927 (+1 intrus); mmarco 118M 0.45 / 0.58 | recall@3 ≥ 0.90, Spearman ≥ 0.95 | Refuted |

### Benchmarks (E05)

CPU OpenVINO INT8 (the shipped target) for H23; GPU fp16 for the fidelity grids; the mmBERT architecture probes on CPU.

- **shipped reranker grid** - ~67 s/pair CPU INT8, ~99% of the chain; the 109 s figure includes the diagnostic R1 NLI sweep the shipped relevance-gate + R2 chain never runs
- **H23 length-bucketing** - one-document grid (910 pairs) `73.2 s -> 42.0 s`, a `43%` CPU cut at bit-identical relevance (Spearman `1.0000`); `2.82x` padded-token waste, median pair 57 tokens padded to 256
- **H20 candidates** - mmarco-MiniLM 118M and jina 278M would cut CPU `85-88%` (param ratio) if faithful, but neither holds the v2-m3 ranking
- **H24 clustering** - amortized once per source; `36%` column cut at the recall-safe `k = 45`, `>= 50%` only by breaking fidelity (recall `0.76` at `k = 35`)

## E06 - experiment batch 6: trained multilingual scorers and the reserved speed win

Three CPU levers picking up where E05 stopped, all over the same `data/interim/exec-summaries/ibm-ai-adoption` fixture, executed in [`notebooks/experiments/E06-kj-trained-scorers-cpu.ipynb`](../../notebooks/experiments/E06-kj-trained-scorers-cpu.ipynb). E05 left two directions explicitly untested - a *trained* multilingual late-interaction ColBERT and a *trained* multilingual learned-sparse scorer (its probes ran on an untrained mmBERT backbone) - and one finding short of its gate (length-bucketing, a `43%` CPU cut at bit-identical scores). E06 runs the two trained scorers and promotes length-bucketing, scored against a looser gate.

- **Aim** - lift the shipped source-conditioned chain on CPU, in either a performance metric (fidelity, resolution) or CPU latency, without regressing a correctness guardrail
- **CPU is the target** - GPU fp16 is already ~63x and not the concern; every latency number is CPU OpenVINO INT8, as in E05
- **Trained, not proxy** - E06-H26/H27 load real retrieval-fine-tuned multilingual models (`jina-colbert-v2`, `bge-m3` sparse) where E05-H21/H22 used an untrained mmBERT backbone, the difference the E05 verdicts named as the open upper bound
- **Reserved speed candidate** - E06-H25 re-scores length-bucketing end-to-end on the full relevance-gated `D_grd` over all 11 documents and, under the looser gate, promotes it from refuted-near-miss to the reserved CPU-speed candidate
- **Isolated env** - the trained scorers pin transformers `< 5` and so run in a separate venv as notebook-orchestrated subprocesses, their score grids saved to disk; the v2-m3 reference grid, the H11 relevance-gate and length-bucketing run in the project kernel (transformers 5.0.0)

### E06 gate - a lift over the shipped chain in metrics or CPU latency

The batch is judged against one acceptance gate, fixed before any run, looser than the E05 `>= 50%` cut: a lever ships if it raises a metric or cuts CPU latency over the shipped chain while holding every correctness guardrail.

- **Win condition** - a lift over the shipped chain in EITHER a performance metric (fidelity: recall of the v2-m3 top-3, `D_grd` Spearman; or resolution: dynamic range) OR CPU latency, AND `0` `D_sel` violations AND `0` new gold intrusions on `D_grd` AND Set 2 above Set 1 severity
- **Reference to hold** - the shipped operating point (the v2-m3 reranker grid, the H11 relevance-gated `D_grd`, the H14 blend) on the existing fixture
- **Difference from E05** - E05 demanded a `>= 50%` CPU cut and refuted all five; E06 asks for any lift over the status quo, so a portable speed win or a trained-scorer fidelity / cascade win that the E05 hard bar excluded can ship
- **Out of scope** - cross-fixture generalization, parked for a separate second-source fixture

### E06-H25 Length-bucketing as the reserved CPU-speed candidate

- **Hypothesis** - because E05-H23 already cut the one-document CPU reranker grid `43%` at bit-identical scores yet was scored against a `>= 50%` gate it narrowly missed, validating it end-to-end on the full relevance-gated `D_grd` over all 11 documents and re-scoring against the E06 lift gate will confirm a portable CPU latency lift (`>= 40%`) at a preserved verdict and promote it from refuted-near-miss to the reserved shipping candidate
- **Lever** - tokenization / batch ordering (length-bucket the flat reranker pair list, tighten `max_length` to the per-call 100th-percentile pair length); portable, not a model change, composes with the chain
- **Prediction** - end-to-end CPU `D_grd` reranker latency cut `>= 40%` across all 11 documents at `D_grd` Spearman `>= 0.999`, `0` new gold intrusions, Set 2 above Set 1 held, `0` real pair truncated
- **Acceptance bar** - any CPU latency lift at a preserved verdict (Spearman `>= 0.999` AND `0` new intrusions AND `0` real pair truncated) -> Ships as the reserved CPU-speed candidate
- **Kill-gate** - padded-token waste `>= 1.5x` on the all-document grid (E05 measured `2.82x` on one document); already-tight pairs -> no headroom -> kill

### E06-H26 Trained multilingual late-interaction (ColBERT)

- **Hypothesis** - because E05-H21's late-interaction MaxSim ran on an untrained mmBERT backbone (recall@3 `0.47`, short of the `0.80` probe) while a trained multilingual ColBERT is retrieval-fine-tuned to preserve token-level relevance, a trained ColBERT scoring the source-cached MaxSim grid will recall the v2-m3 top-3 far better than the untrained proxy and lift either fidelity (recall, Spearman) or - as a cached CPU pre-filter shortlisting the top-`m` before v2-m3 - CPU latency at a preserved verdict
- **Lever** - relevance scorer architecture (trained multilingual late-interaction), as replacement (MaxSim relevance directly) or cached CPU pre-filter feeding v2-m3 on the top-`m`; candidate `jinaai/jina-colbert-v2` (multilingual, ~560M, via `pylate`), source token vectors cached once per source
- **Prediction** - trained MaxSim recall@3 of the v2-m3 top-3 clears the `0.80` probe the untrained proxy failed (`0.47`); as a pre-filter recall@`m` `>= 0.95` at `m < 35`, a net CPU cut over the full grid at `D_grd` Spearman `>= 0.95`
- **Acceptance bar** - a lift over the shipped chain in EITHER fidelity (recall@3 `>= 0.90` replace, OR recall@`m` `>= 0.95` at `m < 35` cascade, at Spearman `>= 0.95`) OR net CPU latency, with `0` new gold intrusions and Set 2 above Set 1
- **Kill-gate** - trained MaxSim recall@3 must beat the untrained proxy `0.47` and the cosine floor `0.385` on a probe (`>= 0.60`); at or below -> training did not help on this fixture -> kill

### E06-H27 Trained multilingual learned-sparse (bge-m3)

- **Hypothesis** - because E05-H22's learned-sparse proxy was an untrained mmBERT MLM head (recall@15 `0.34`, below the cosine floor `0.61`) while a trained multilingual learned-sparse model is retrieval-fine-tuned, the bge-m3 sparse lexical-weight output scoring the source-cached sparse grid will catch the term-overlap evidence the pooled vector dropped and lift either fidelity or - as a very cheap cached CPU pre-filter - CPU latency at a preserved verdict
- **Lever** - relevance scorer architecture (trained multilingual learned-sparse), cached CPU pre-filter; candidate `BAAI/bge-m3` sparse / lexical-weight mode (via `FlagEmbedding`), source sparse vectors cached once per source
- **Prediction** - trained sparse recall@`m` of the v2-m3 top-3 `>= 0.95` at `m < 35`, a sub-second CPU sparse pre-filter, net CPU cut over the full grid at `D_grd` Spearman `>= 0.95`
- **Acceptance bar** - a lift over the shipped chain in EITHER fidelity (recall@`m` `>= 0.95` at `m < 35`) OR net CPU latency, with `0` new gold intrusions and Set 2 above Set 1
- **Kill-gate** - trained sparse recall@15 must beat the untrained proxy `0.34` and the cosine floor `0.612` on a probe (`>= 0.80` at `m = 15`); at or below -> kill

### Pre-registration table (E06)

| hypothesis | lever | prediction | acceptance bar | kill-gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E06-H25 length-bucketing | tokenization | CPU cut ≥ 40% at identical scores | any CPU cut AND Spearman ≥ 0.999 AND 0 new AND 0 truncated | padded-token waste ≥ 1.5x on the all-doc grid |
| E06-H26 trained ColBERT | scorer architecture | recall@3 ≥ 0.90 / recall@m ≥ 0.95, net CPU cut | fidelity lift (recall) OR CPU cut, Spearman ≥ 0.95, 0 new | trained MaxSim recall@3 ≥ 0.60 (beats proxy 0.47) |
| E06-H27 trained sparse (bge-m3) | scorer architecture | recall@m ≥ 0.95 at m<35, net CPU cut | fidelity lift (recall) OR CPU cut, Spearman ≥ 0.95, 0 new | sparse recall@15 ≥ 0.80 (beats proxy 0.34) |

### Results (E06)

| hypothesis | measured | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| E06-H25 length-bucketing | 47.7% CPU cut (860.4 → 449.8 s over 8960 pairs), score Spearman 0.99994, D_grd Spearman 1.0, 0 → 0 gold intrusions, Set 2 > Set 1; padded-token waste 2.58x, p100 256, 0 real pair truncated | Ships (reserved CPU-speed candidate) |
| E06-H26 trained ColBERT (jina-colbert-v2) | recall@3 0.471 (untrained proxy 0.47, cosine 0.385, kill-gate 0.60), Spearman 0.55, 3 intrusions, recall reaches 0.95 only at m = 37 (> 34) | Killed at gate |
| E06-H27 trained sparse (bge-m3) | recall@3 0.557, recall@15 0.823 (proxy 0.34, cosine 0.612, kill-gate 0.80), Spearman -0.770, 6 intrusions, recall@0.95 at m = 39 (> 34) | Refuted |

The trained scorers refute the open E05 direction with real retrieval-fine-tuned models. The trained multilingual ColBERT lands recall@3 0.471 - statistically on top of the untrained mmBERT proxy 0.47 - so training the late-interaction scorer adds no fidelity on this source-conditioned grounding task. The trained sparse scorer buys recall (0.823 at 15, clearing its 0.80 kill-gate) only by inverting the ranking (Spearman -0.770), the same recall-vs-order split E03 saw. Neither replaces the v2-m3 cross-encoder nor cascades safely at m < 34. Only length-bucketing clears the lift gate - a 47.7% CPU cut at numerically preserved scores - and ships as the reserved CPU-speed candidate, now wired into the statement encoder.

A correctness note: the first H26 run returned an all-NaN ColBERT grid (a near-random recall@3 0.003 artifact). jina-colbert-v2's flash-attention XLM-R CPU forward returns NaN over padded positions; `batch_size=1` removes the padding and restores recall@3 0.471, and the scorer now asserts finiteness so the failure cannot recur silently.

## Lessons learned

- **Baseline near the ceiling for ordering** - perfect ordinality and `d' = 2.70` leave little room; resolution (dynamic range), not the normalized boundary, is the axis with room
- **Anisotropy is the bottleneck** - the one lever that helps removes a single common principal component, de-bunches the cosines, triples dynamic range
- **Number-aware weighting is self-defeating on number-heavy sources** - both the faithful and the info-noise tiers carry the article's percentages, so up-weighting numbers pulls adversarial summaries toward gold
- **A wider mean gap is not a wider boundary** - E01-H1 raises `R` while the boundary margin turns negative; `V` catches what `R` hides
- **Heavier machinery did not pay** - unbalanced OT (non-metric, ~120x) and tail aggregation (noise at ~12 statements) both underperform the cheap exact mean
- **Conditioning on the source separates failure modes (E02)** - the symmetric distance cannot tell info-loss from fabrication; re-basing the transport onto `S` and adding a grounding axis does, the source-conditioned design's central claim confirmed
- **Single-premise NLI mis-grades compression (E02)** - a faithful summary statement fuses several source sentences, so no single source premise entails it; top-k joint-premise aggregation is required, not optional (R1 muddied, R2 fixed it)
- **General NLI is weak on numbers (E02)** - the contradiction signal barely fires even on fabricated forecasts, so the grounding residual rides on the ungrounded component - a numeric-aware verifier is the open gap
- **Relevance, not entailment, separates compression from fabrication (E03)** - gating the ungrounded mass by max reranker relevance closes the gold intrusion the entailment residual could not, because faithful compression has high relevance and low entailment while fabrication has both low
- **Number density defeats the numeric verifier (E03)** - on an 82-figure source, whole-source matching lets fabricated numbers match by coincidence (Set 2 collapses to 0.05) while top-k localized matching flags faithful restatements whose aligned source is elsewhere (gold rises to 0.08); the same density that makes numbers the adversarial signal makes them un-verifiable here
- **The cross-encoder reranker is load-bearing (E03)** - the bi-encoder cosine neither shortlists faithfully (recall@10 of top-3 is 0.58) nor replaces relevance (Spearman 0.40); the 60% reranker cost is structural to the grounding design, not removable with the embeddings already on hand
- **Separability is not correct ordering (E03)** - the symmetric SMD separates Set 1 from Set 2 on this fixture but inverts the severity (info-loss read as more divergent than fabrication); the conditioned blend's win is the correct ordering and the axis attribution, which a single source-blind scalar cannot give regardless of separability
- **Anisotropy carries to the conditioned axis (E04)** - the E01-H3 lever, applied to the conditioned `D_sel` over the pooled {A,B,S} corpus, widens dynamic range ~7.4x at `0` violations, a larger gain than on the symmetric distance (3.2x) because the conditioned coverage profiles start more bunched; like E01-H3 it is resolution not a sharper boundary (contrast unchanged)
- **Coverage temperature trades contrast for range (E04)** - sharpening the soft source assignment spreads the distances but within-tier, so a lower `τ` raises DR while lowering the gold/adversarial contrast and breaking ordinality; the predicted contrast gain is the wrong direction
- **The cross-encoder is load-bearing against its own family (E04)** - a distilled same-family `bge-reranker-base` recalls only 0.55 of the `v2-m3` top-3 and changes the ranking (Spearman 0.70); even keeping cross-attention, a smaller reranker is not a faithful replacement
- **A cross-encoder cascade is the closest faithful speed-up (E04)** - a tiny MiniLM pre-filter clears the fidelity (Spearman 0.98) and speed (2.3x) bars where the E03 bi-encoder could not (0.55), but at `m = 15` still drops 13% of the top-3 evidence and adds a gold intrusion; the reranker cost stands, the cascade is the open direction
- **The cross-encoder floor holds across six candidate classes (E05)** - two multilingual cross-encoders (mmarco-MiniLM 118M recall@3 0.45, jina 278M 0.63), late-interaction MaxSim (0.47) and a learned-sparse proxy (0.08) all fail to recall the `v2-m3` top-3 (bar 0.90), jina the closest at `D_grd` Spearman 0.927; with E03 (bi-encoder) and E04 (distilled, English MiniLM) that is six scorer classes - the cross-encoder is irreplaceable on this fixture
- **Padding, not precision, is the free CPU lever (E05)** - the reranker pairs carry 2.82x padded-token waste (median 57 tokens padded to 256); length-bucketing cuts the CPU INT8 reranker 43% at bit-identical scores, a real free win short of the 50% bar; the grid is compute-bound (an encoder, no KV cache), so lower precision is not the lever
- **A redundant source is not a compressible one (E05)** - 91% of the 70 source statements have a `>= 0.85` neighbour (`k_eff` 10), but the redundancy is soft: clustering to half (k=35) drops top-3 recall to 0.76 and breaks the grounding ranking - near-duplicate sources are interchangeable for retrieval but not collapsible without losing the fine distinctions `D_grd` needs; index-recall understates fidelity here, so `D_grd` Spearman is the truer measure
- **Training does not lift the late-interaction floor (E06)** - a trained multilingual ColBERT (jina-colbert-v2) MaxSim recall@3 `0.471` lands exactly on the untrained mmBERT proxy `0.47`; retrieval fine-tuning adds no fidelity on this source-conditioned grounding task, so the E05 "untrained backbone" caveat is closed - the floor is the architecture, not the training
- **Learned-sparse buys recall by inverting order (E06)** - trained bge-m3 sparse recall@15 `0.823` finally beats the cosine floor `0.612`, but its `D_grd` Spearman is `-0.770`; lexical term-weight scoring catches the overlap the pooled vector dropped yet orders the documents backwards, so no safe cascade (`m@0.95 = 39 > 34`) - the recall-vs-order split of E03, again
- **The cross-encoder floor holds against trained scorers too (E06)** - with E03 (bi-encoder), E04 (distilled, English MiniLM) and E05 (multilingual cross-encoders, untrained late-interaction / sparse) already ruled out, E06 adds trained multilingual late-interaction and trained learned-sparse; eight scorer classes, none matches the v2-m3 ranking - the grounding cost is structural, not a tuning gap
- **A flash-attention scorer NaNs on CPU padding (E06)** - jina-colbert-v2's flash-attn XLM-R CPU forward returns NaN over padded positions, so a default padded batch silently corrupts the MaxSim grid (an all-zero grid masked by `nan_to_num`, a near-random recall@3 `0.003`); encoding one sequence at a time (`batch_size=1`) removes the padding and fixes it - a methodological caveat for any CPU late-interaction encode

## Conclusions

- **Ships** - baseline exact SMD: metric, 0.08 ms/pair, perfect ordinality
- **Optional** - anisotropy removal (k=1) as a resolution pre-pass, ~2x latency, `d'` caveat noted
- **Thin margin is intrinsic** - all eleven summaries describe one article and share its content, so the boundary is genuinely narrow
- **Source-conditioned axes (E02)** - `D_sel` ships as the selection axis (clean, metric, sub-ms, 0 violations); `D_grd` (R2 joint premise) is a tier-level fabrication flag, ~109 s/pair - E03 turned it into a per-document metric with the H11 relevance-gate, not the numeric verifier E02 expected
- **Grounding axis fix (E03)** - the H11 relevance-gated ungrounded mass closes the per-document gold intrusion (2 → 0) at no extra cost, turning `D_grd` from a tier flag into a per-document discriminator on this fixture; ship it as the grounding-axis definition
- **Blended scalar (E03)** - the H14 blend `α·D_sel + (1−α)·D_grd` (`α ∈ [0.6, 0.9]`) orders the two failure modes correctly (Set 2 fabrication above Set 1 info-loss) where the symmetric scalar inverts them - a single interpretable conditioned scalar; the win is severity ordering and attribution, and needs a second source before it is trusted
- **Not shipped (E03)** - the numeric verifier (defeated by source figure density) and the two reranker-cost levers (cosine neither shortlists nor replaces the cross-encoder); the ~109 s/pair grounding cost stands
- **Resolution lever ships as the default (E04)** - anisotropy removal on the conditioned `D_sel` (`k = 1`, now the shipped default, opt-out via `anisotropy=False`) widens dynamic range ~7.4x at `0` violations, with the E01-H3 caveat that it spreads the band rather than sharpening the boundary
- **Reranker cost still stands (E04)** - neither a distilled replacement (recall 0.55, Spearman 0.70) nor a cross-encoder cascade (recall 0.87 at `m = 15`, one new intrusion) clears the correctness guardrails; the ~109 s/pair grounding cost is unmoved, the cascade the most promising future lever
- **CPU speed: the floor holds, one free win (E05)** - no lever clears the `>= 50%` CPU cut at a preserved verdict; the v2-m3 cross-encoder is reconfirmed irreplaceable (no smaller cross-encoder, late-interaction or sparse scorer recalls its top-3), jina-reranker-v2 the closest (Spearman 0.927). The one shippable improvement is length-bucketing - a `43%` CPU cut at bit-identical scores, `7` points short of the bar but zero correctness risk; ship it as a portable default and keep v2-m3 as the reranker
- **Trained scorers do not move the grounding floor (E06)** - a trained multilingual ColBERT (recall@3 `0.471`, the untrained proxy `0.47`) and a trained learned-sparse bge-m3 (recall@15 `0.823` but Spearman `-0.770`) both fail to replace v2-m3 or cascade safely at `m < 34`; the open E05 direction is closed, the cross-encoder grounding cost is structural across eight scorer classes
- **One CPU win ships (E06)** - length-bucketing, re-scored end-to-end over all 11 documents under the looser lift gate, cuts CPU INT8 reranker latency `47.7%` at score Spearman `0.99994` / `D_grd` Spearman `1.0` and `0` intrusion change; promoted from the E05 refuted-near-miss to the reserved CPU-speed candidate and wired into the shipped statement encoder (`OpenVINOEncoder` / `TorchEncoder`), where the same padded-batch waste lives

## Next steps

- **Promote the E03 winners** - wire the H11 relevance-gated ungrounded mass into the grounding axis as `D_grd`, and expose the H14 blend (`α ≈ 0.75`) as the single source-conditioned scalar; the per-document intrusion is closed and the failure modes order correctly
- **E04 resolution lever shipped** - the H15 anisotropy pre-pass (`k = 1`) is now the default on the conditioned `D_sel` (`anisotropy=False` to opt out), wired through the library (`compute_source_conditioned`, `distance_wrt_source`) and the CLI (`--no-anisotropy`); folded into the SOTA design doc alongside the symmetric E01-H3 anisotropy
- **E04 cascade near-miss, closed by E05** - the E04-H18 MiniLM→`v2-m3` cascade was the open direction (recall@15 0.87); E05 tested a larger `m` and a multilingual pre-filter (mmarco-MiniLM) and they fail too - jina-reranker-v2 only reaches recall@m 0.95 at `m = 34` (half the source), so no cascade clears the gate with a real saving
- **Cross-fixture check (parked, separate fixture)** - the H14 win is severity ordering and attribution on one article, where the symmetric scalar also clears 0/28 gold-vs-adv; a second-source fixture is prepared separately later, then E02/E03/E04 re-run on it before claiming the blend beats symmetric in general; E04 itself is scored on the existing fixture meanwhile
- **Anisotropy continuation (parked, E01 lineage)** - still open: sweep the anisotropy `k` further and test a gentle numeric weight tuned to preserve `V` stacked on anisotropy removal; source-free, distinct from E04-H15, which applies anisotropy removal to the conditioned `D_sel`, not the symmetric distance
- **E06 closes the trained-scorer thread** - no trained multilingual late-interaction or learned-sparse model clears the cross-encoder floor; the only open grounding-speed lever is the E04-H18 cross-encoder cascade on a faithful pre-filter, not a cheaper scorer
- **Length-bucketing wired into the statement encoder (E06-H25)** - the lever now batches `OpenVINOEncoder` / `TorchEncoder` by token length; the `47.7%` is reranker-grid-measured, the statement-encoder CPU cut is benchmarked separately in [`notebooks/10-kj-encoder-length-bucketing.ipynb`](../../notebooks/10-kj-encoder-length-bucketing.ipynb)
- **Open grounding cost** - the reranker grid stands as the ~99% bottleneck (~67 s/pair shipped CPU; the ~109 s figure includes the diagnostic R1 NLI sweep the shipped `D_grd` skips); E03/E04/E05 ruled out six scorer classes (bi-encoder, distilled and multilingual cross-encoders, late-interaction, learned-sparse) - none recalls the v2-m3 top-3; the structural wins are length-bucketing (43%, shippable) and source clustering (36% safe ceiling), neither alone reaching 50%
- **Ship the E05 length-bucketing win** - length-sort the reranker pair list and tighten `max_length` to the per-call 100th-percentile pair length; a `43%` CPU cut at bit-identical scores, portable, the one E05 lever worth wiring into the grounding chain when it lands in the library
- **E05 open replacement directions** - jina-reranker-v2 (278M) is the closest faithful cross-encoder (Spearman 0.927, short of 0.95); a mid-size multilingual cross-encoder and a *trained* multilingual ColBERT / SPLADE are untested (the E05 architecture probes ran on an untrained mmBERT backbone, and no `FlagEmbedding`/`pylate` in the environment) - these are the open scorer hunts, not the small models tried so far
- **Refuted, do not revisit** - salience / numeric weighting (breaks ordinality on number-heavy sources), angular cost (null), unbalanced residual (worse, slow, non-metric), tail aggregation (noise at this statement count), single-premise grounding (mis-grades compression, superseded by R2 joint premise), numeric verifier (defeated by source figure density, E03-H10), bi-encoder cascade / replacement (cosine neither shortlists nor replaces the cross-encoder, E03-H12/H13), smaller / distilled / multilingual cross-encoder replacement (E04-H17, E05-H20 - none recalls the v2-m3 top-3), late-interaction MaxSim and learned-sparse over an untrained backbone (E05-H21/H22 - below the gate; a *trained* ColBERT/SPLADE is still open), source-statement clustering past ~36% (E05-H24 - breaks the grounding ranking)
