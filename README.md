Semantic distance between two documents via Statement Mover's Distance - optimal transport over mmBERT statement embeddings, after Kusner et al. 2015 ([*From Word Embeddings To Document Distances*](references/papers/%5Bpaper%5D%20From%20Word%20Embeddings%20To%20Document%20Distances.pdf)). A thin frontend to the library; the SOTA docs carry the mechanics, benchmarks, and validation.

- **Input** - two documents, raw text or a file path
- **Output** - an SMD distance, a 0..1 closeness, a verdict, and the statement alignment
- **Use** - agentic document conversion and extraction pipelines, where token logits are unavailable and KL divergence cannot be computed
- **Unit** - statement-level and position-invariant, with an interpretable transport plan

## Theory

A document distance grounded in embeddings and optimal transport, not surface overlap.

- **WMD** - Word Mover's Distance (Kusner et al. 2015) casts document similarity as optimal transport between embedded tokens
- **SMD** - this project lifts it to statements: segment, embed, transport between the two statement clouds
- **Beyond cosine** - whole-document cosine collapses when the same claims sit in a different place or order; statement-level transport is position-invariant
- **Metric** - the ground cost `√(2 − 2cos)` on L2-normalized embeddings is a metric, so the document distance is one too
- **Logit-free** - an embedding-grounded alternative where token probabilities (KL divergence) are unavailable, as in frontier-model pipelines

## Method

Three stages; the transport plan is the interpretable by-product.

1. **Segment** - split each document into atomic statements with the SAT (Segment Any Text) segmenter
2. **Embed** - encode each statement with the mmBERT contextual encoder (mean-pooled, L2-normalized)
3. **Compare** - optimal transport between the two statement clouds (Statement Mover's Distance), optionally unbalanced so added or missing statements are scored, not force-matched

- **Closeness** - `1 − SMD/√2`, on a 0..1 scale
- **Source-conditioned** - a variant `d(A, B | S)` re-bases the transport onto a shared source `S` and reads off a selection axis and a grounding axis

## Which distance

Both compare two documents; they differ in what the answer tells you and what you must supply.

- **Method 1 - symmetric distance (robust, fast)** - answers *how far apart are A and B?* as one number (a 0..1 closeness plus a similar / not-similar verdict). Sub-millisecond, needs only the two documents, and is a true metric - the distance is symmetric and obeys the triangle inequality, so the numbers are consistent enough to threshold, rank and cache. The production default; use it whenever you need a reliable similarity score - dedup, drift detection, "did this conversion change the meaning?"
- **Method 2 - source-conditioned `d(A, B | S)` (slower, experimental)** - answers *why do A and B differ, given a shared source S?* You supply `S`, and instead of one number it returns two axes: a selection axis (did A and B pick different parts of the source?) and a grounding axis (did one drift from the source - dropped content vs unsupported or fabricated content?). It runs a cross-encoder × NLI pass (~seconds on GPU, far slower on CPU). Use it to audit a summary or an extraction against its source, when "how far" is not enough and you need to name the failure
- **Which to pick** - default to Method 1 for a similarity number; reach for Method 2 only when you hold the shared source and need to know *why* two documents derived from it diverge. Method 2's value is interpretation and ordering the failure modes correctly, not a higher pass rate, and it is validated on a single fixture so far - validate on your own sources first

## Usage

The quickest way to a result is the CLI - init once, then run it.

```bash
pip install docdistance                        # from PyPI ('docdistance[s3]' to pull models from S3)
docdistance init wmd                           # provision the symmetric-distance models (once)
docdistance init wmd-wrt-source                # + the reranker + NLI grounding models
docdistance --help                             # full reference (or <command> --help)

# method 1 - symmetric distance (robust, fast, the default)
docdistance distance a.md b.md                 # rich verdict (add --json for machine-readable)
docdistance distance a.md b.md --transport-map-json map.json   # + statement → statement map

# method 2 - source-conditioned d(A,B|S) (slower, runs the reranker × NLI grounding)
docdistance distance-wrt-source a.md b.md --source s.md                       # two-axis verdict
docdistance distance-wrt-source a.md b.md -s s.md --source-map-json map.json   # + statement → source map
```

`init` provisions a mode's models from HuggingFace by default, or from S3 (`--source s3://your-bucket --aws-profile NAME`) or a local mirror (`--source /path/to/models`), and records readiness in a `docdistance.json` written to `$DOCDISTANCE_HOME` or the current folder. A distance run whose mode was never init'd exits with a clear "run `docdistance init <mode>`" error.

Or from Python:

```python
import docdistance
from docdistance import document_distance, source_conditioned_distance

docdistance.init("wmd")                                         # provision once (writes docdistance.json)
r = document_distance("report_v1.md", "report_v2.md")           # method 1
print(r.closeness, r.verdict)               # 0..1 closeness, "similar" | "not similar"

docdistance.init("wmd-wrt-source")                              # + reranker + NLI grounding models
s = source_conditioned_distance("sum_a.md", "sum_b.md", source="article.md")  # method 2
print(s.d_sel, s.grd_a, s.grd_b)            # selection divergence + each doc's grounding residual
```

### Reading the result

- **Method 1 - closeness 0..1** - `1.0` identical, `0.0` unrelated. Good (same meaning): closeness near 1, verdict `similar` (default cutoff `0.725`, set with `--threshold`). Bad (meaning changed): closeness falls toward 0, verdict flips to `not similar`
- **Method 2 - two axes, lower is closer** - `d_sel` near 0 means A and B drew on the same source content, high means they picked different parts; `grd_a` / `grd_b` are each document's reranker x NLI grounding residual (E03-H11 relevance-gated ungrounded mass) - low means it stays grounded in `S`, high flags drift (dropped or unsupported content). Good: both grounding residuals and `d_sel` low. Bad: a grounding residual spikes for the document that drifted

- **Transport map** - add `--transport-map-json map.json` to `distance` to also write the optimal-transport map: for every statement of A, which statements of B its mass flows to, with the `weight` (fraction of that statement's mass) and the match `cost` - the interpretable statement-to-statement alignment behind the distance, readable by a human or a machine (the same map is returned in Python by `DocDistance.distance_with_map`)
- **Source map** - add `--source-map-json map.json` to `distance-wrt-source` to also write, for every statement of A and B, the top-3 source statements it covers with their weights - a per-statement alignment showing *which part of the source* each statement draws on
- **Offline after init** - distance calls run fully offline once `docdistance init <mode>` has provisioned the mode (from HuggingFace, S3, or a local mirror) and written `docdistance.json`
- **Backend** - `--backend openvino|torch`, default `openvino` (CPU INT8)
- **Full reference** - the [CLI reference](docs/cli-reference.md), the [API reference](docs/api-reference.md) and the [AWS deployment reference](docs/aws-deployment-reference.md)

### Transport map output

`--transport-map-json` writes the exact optimal-transport coupling behind the distance - for each statement of A, the statements of B its probability mass moves to (one flow shown, a clean 1:1 match):

```json
{
  "smd": 0.286827,
  "anisotropy": false,
  "n_statements": { "a": 12, "b": 11 },
  "flows": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "text": "Among large organizations with more than 1,000 …",
      "matches": [
        { "target_index": 1, "target_text": "About 42% of organizations with more than 1,000 …", "weight": 1.0, "cost": 0.2237 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **flows** - one entry per statement of A; `index` / `text` name it, `matches` are the B statements its mass lands on
- **weight** - fraction of that statement's mass to the target, sums to 1 per statement; a lone `1.0` is a clean 1:1 match, several smaller weights mean the statement splits across B
- **cost** - ground distance `√(2 − 2cos)` of the matched pair; low = semantically close, high = a forced move
- **smd** - the distance the map realizes; `weight × cost` summed over all flows equals it
- **Reading it** - a statement mapped to its counterpart at `weight 1.0` and low `cost` is preserved; high cost or scattered weights flag a statement with no clean equivalent in B
